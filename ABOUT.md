# GreenLend: AI-Powered Sustainable Finance

---

## Inspiration
**Financial exclusion meets climate crisis.** While researching Indonesia's MSME sector, we discovered a heartbreaking reality: 70% of small business loan applications are rejected due to "insufficient credit history." Meanwhile, sustainable businesses—organic farmers, solar installers, waste recyclers—struggle to access capital despite their positive environmental impact.

We met **Ibu Siti**, a mushroom farmer contributing to food security (SDG 2) and climate action (SDG 13), who was denied a loan because she had no credit card or formal banking history. Traditional banks couldn't see her value. We asked: *What if we measured IMPACT instead of just credit scores?*

**GreenLend** was born from this question: *How can we unlock finance for those creating a sustainable future, using AI to evaluate what truly matters—not traditional metrics that exclude 1.4 billion unbanked people globally?*

## What It Does
GreenLend is an AI-driven microfinance platform that democratizes access to capital by scoring sustainability impact alongside creditworthiness.

### For Borrowers (The Unbanked):
- **Conversational AI Application**: Low-literacy entrepreneurs apply through natural language chat in English or Bahasa Indonesia—no complex forms.
- **Alternative Credit Scoring**: Our AI evaluates business viability, SDG contributions, and community impact instead of traditional credit history.
- **Instant Assessment**: Real-time evaluation of 15+ factors including environmental impact, social benefit, and repayment capacity.

### For Lenders (Impact Investors):
- **SDG-Aligned Portfolio**: Dashboard showing real-time sustainability metrics (CO₂ reduced, jobs created, women empowered).
- **Transparent Risk Assessment**: Every loan includes credit scores (0-100), SDG impact scores (0-100), and detailed business analysis.
- **Dual Disbursement**: PayPal for instant traditional disbursement, or blockchain (Ethereum Sepolia) for transparent, immutable records.
- **Portfolio Analytics**: Track financial returns AND environmental impact across all investments.

## The Innovation: SDG-Based Credit Scoring
Our proprietary algorithm evaluates three components:
1. **Traditional Factors (20%)**: Business experience, revenue stability
2. **Alternative Data (50%)**: Business model viability, market opportunity, owner commitment
3. **SDG Contribution (30%)**: Environmental impact, social benefit, alignment with UN Sustainability Goals

**Result**: A mushroom farmer with zero credit history but high SDG alignment can access capital. A solar panel installer is rewarded with better interest rates for clean energy contributions.

## How We Built It

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.8, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: OpenAI GPT-4 with custom structured prompts for conversational loan applications
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.19 deployed on Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ethers.js v6, RainbowKit for wallet connectivity (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect)
- **Payment Processing**: PayPal API for traditional disbursement
- **Authentication**: RainbowKit Web3 wallet authentication

### Architecture Highlights:
1. **AI Conversational Engine**
   - Engineered structured prompts to extract 15+ data points from natural conversation
   - Bilingual NLP processing (English/Bahasa Indonesia)
   - Real-time business viability assessment with follow-up questions
   - Automatic SDG mapping based on business type and impact description

2. **Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm**
   - **Final Credit Score** = (Traditional × 0.2) + (Alternative × 0.5) + (SDG × 0.3)
   - **Interest Rate** = Base Rate + Risk Premium - SDG Discount
     - Base: 10%
     - Risk: 0-5% based on credit score
     - SDG Discount: Up to 3% for high-impact businesses

3. **Smart Contract Design**
   - `disburseLoan()`: Records loan with borrower address, amount, credit/SDG scores on-chain
   - `repayLoan()`: Processes repayments with interest calculations
   - `getLoan()`: Transparent loan data retrieval for auditing
   - **Events**: LoanDisbursed, LoanRepaid for real-time tracking

4. **Scalable Data Architecture**
   - Client-side state management with React hooks
   - LocalStorage for demo persistence (production would use PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
   - Modular component architecture for maintainability

## Challenges We Ran Into
1. **Balancing Simplicity with Sophistication**  
   - **Challenge**: Low-literacy users need simple interfaces, but lenders need comprehensive data.  
   - **Solution**: Created two distinct UX flows—conversational chat for borrowers, data-rich dashboards for lenders.

2. **Blockchain UX Friction**  
   - **Challenge**: Wallet connection errors showing "an embedded page at..." text looked unprofessional for Devpost judges.  
   - **Solution**: Built custom modal dialogs replacing all browser-native prompts with branded GreenLend UI components.

3. **SDG Quantification**  
   - **Challenge**: How do you numerically score "environmental impact" without greenwashing?  
   - **Solution**: Developed rubric mapping specific business activities to concrete SDG targets (e.g., organic farming = SDG 2 "Zero Hunger" + SDG 13 "Climate Action"). Weighted scoring based on primary vs. secondary contributions.

4. **Testnet ETH Management**  
   - **Challenge**: Demo transactions with 15M IDR (~0.33 ETH) depleted faucet tokens too quickly.  
   - **Solution**: Created 8 additional affordable loan samples (1.5M-4.5M IDR) for multiple demo transactions.

5. **AI Prompt Engineering**  
   - **Challenge**: Generic AI responses didn't extract structured loan data consistently.  
   - **Solution**: Engineered multi-turn conversation flows with explicit data extraction rules, validation checks, and error handling in system prompts.

## What We Learned
1. **Impact Measurement is Hard (But Worth It)**  
   Quantifying sustainability isn't straightforward. We learned that combining qualitative assessments (business descriptions) with quantitative metrics (SDG alignment scores) requires careful calibration to avoid both greenwashing and over-penalizing traditional businesses.

2. **Financial Inclusion Requires More Than Technology**  
   Building blockchain features was the easy part. The hard part? Designing for users who've never used a computer. We learned that true inclusion means:
   - Natural language interfaces over forms
   - Visual explanations over text walls
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Bilingual support as a default, not an afterthought

3. **Blockchain as Enhancement, Not Requirement**  
   We initially over-indexed on blockchain. We learned that for judges and users, solving the problem matters more than the tech stack. Blockchain adds transparency and trust, but PayPal integration ensures accessibility. Hybrid approach = best approach.

4. **Explainable AI Builds Trust**  
   When we added the Methodology and Transparency pages, the platform felt more legitimate. We learned that showing "how the sausage is made" doesn't reduce magic—it builds credibility. Users trust AI more when they understand it.

5. **Indonesian MSME Sector is Massive**  
   Through research, we discovered:
   - Indonesia has 64 million MSMEs (99.9% of all businesses!)
   - MSME financing gap: $8.9 billion annually
   - 77% of Indonesians have no bank account  
   This isn't a small problem—it's a massive opportunity for impact.
